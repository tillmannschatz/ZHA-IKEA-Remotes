# ZHA - IKEA remotes (double and triple clicks)

Control everything with IKEA remotes.
Every button is fully customizable and can be double and triple clicked.
When holding the up/down/left/right button you can also choose an action to trigger repeatedly.

## Todo:
- double / triple clicks are not recognized --> acting as single clicks
- implement smooth transition (see: https://community.home-assistant.io/t/ikea-e1743-tradfri-on-off-switch-zha-with-smoother-dimming/665166)
